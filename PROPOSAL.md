## Project Choice

- [ ] Reconstruction of Space Cowboys' Splendor

## Project Description 

My app is called Splendor. It is a game app for two to four players who want to play an web-based version of Splendor. The plan is to follow the exact rules (see rules at https://www.spacecowboys.fr/_files/ugd/59baa2_17984c1d5d0b45a6ae3cdc695c0a864e.pdf). Users will prompted to input the amout of players playing the game, with an icebox project of adding bot players. From there, the board will be 'set' and instead of asking who is the youngest, a player will be chosen at random to go first.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I would like to be able to change my mind on what my gameplay decsion is through a confirmation button present on the UI.
- As a player, I would like to have a history of player options
- As a player, I would like to have visibility of all player resources.
- As a player I would like to be able to restart the game after a win, loss or when everyone walks away from the game.

#### Stretch Goals

- As a player, I would like the game UI to be dynamic and mobile friendly.
- As a player, I would like to play this game online so that I don't have to have my challenger sitting next to me.
- As a player, I would like to hear an audible sound when I mark a game box so that I know my selection worked.
