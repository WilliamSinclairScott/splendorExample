- [ ] Reconstruction of Space Cowboys' Splendor

## Project Description 

My app is called Splendor. It is a game app for two to four players who want to play an online version of Splendor locally. The plan is to follow the exact rules (see rules at https://www.spacecowboys.fr/_files/ugd/59baa2_17984c1d5d0b45a6ae3cdc695c0a864e.pdf). Users will prompted to input the amout of players playing the game, with an icebox project of adding bot players. From there, the board will be 'set' and instead of asking who is the youngest, a player will be chosen at random to go first.

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want to understand what gameplay options are available to me, and which one's are not through highlighting and greyed out UI.
- As a player, I would like to be able to change my mind on what my gameplay decsion is through a confirmation button present on the UI.
- As a player, I would like to know whose turn it is so that I don't have to keep track.
- As a player, I would like to have a history of player options, and visibility of all player resources.
- As a player I would like to be able to restart the game after a win, loss or when everyone walks away from the game.
- As a player, I want the UI to be engaging and out of the way so that I enjoy the experience of playing the game.\*\*
- As a player who requires assistive technologies, I would like accessibility features so that I'm not left out of enjoying the game.

#### Stretch Goals

- As a player, I would like a victory animation when I win the game, so that I feel good about my victory!
- As a player, I would like to hear an audible sound when I mark a game box so that I know my selection worked.
- As a player, I would like to play this game online so that I don't have to have my challenger sitting next to me.
